# Excel Data Collection Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I store and share Excel spreadsheets containing various datasets that I have collected.

##  Repository Structure
This repository contains multiple folders, each dedicated to a specific dataset or project. Below is a brief description of some key folders:

- **Liga MX with Relegation**
  - Contains spreadsheets analyzing the Liga MX Clausura season with a hypothetical reinstatement of relegation.
  - Includes data on promotions and relegations, based on past seasons and adjusted for the dissolution of Ascenso MX and the introduction of Liga de Expansi√≥n.
  - Determines the correct relegation and promotion placements based on a coefficient system and playoff structure.

## Data Overview
The datasets in this repository vary in structure, but they typically include:
- Historical and current data
- Data transformations and calculations for specific scenarios
